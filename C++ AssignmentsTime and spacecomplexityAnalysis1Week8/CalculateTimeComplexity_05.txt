Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.
int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
c +=i;
}

Answer

Explanation:
The loop starts with i = 0 and increments i by 1 in each iteration.
The loop continues until i becomes equal to n.
During each iteration, c += i adds the value of i to c.

The loop runs from i = 0 to i = n - 1, meaning the number of iterations is exactly n.
Each iteration involves a constant-time operation (c += i), which takes O(1) time per iteration.

Time Complexity:
Since the loop runs n times and each iteration takes O(1) time, the overall time complexity is O(n).
Thus, the time complexity of the code is O(n).
