Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.

int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){
c++;
}
}

Answer

Explanation:
The outer loop runs from i = 0 to i = n - 1, so it executes n times.
The inner loop runs from j = 0 to j = i - 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, meaning it runs i times for each value of i.
When i = 0, the inner loop runs 0 times.
When i = 1, the inner loop runs 1 time.
When i = 2, the inner loop runs 2 times.
...
When i = n - 1, the inner loop runs n - 1 times.

Time Complexity:Since the total number of iterations grows quadratically with n, the time complexity of the code is O(nÂ²).
