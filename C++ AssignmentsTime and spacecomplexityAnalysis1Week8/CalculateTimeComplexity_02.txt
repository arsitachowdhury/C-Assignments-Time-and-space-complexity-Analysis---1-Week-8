Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.
int c = 0;
for(int i = n; i > 1; i /= i) {
c++;
}

Answer

Explanation:
The loop starts with i = n.
On each iteration, i is updated with i /= i. This means i is being divided by itself.
Mathematically, i / i = 1, so after the first iteration, i becomes 1, and in the next iteration, the loop terminates because the condition i > 1 is no longer satisfied.

Regardless of the initial value of n, i becomes 1 after the first iteration, and the loop terminates.
Therefore, the loop executes only once.

Time Complexity:
Since the loop runs a constant number of times (just once), the time complexity is O(1).
